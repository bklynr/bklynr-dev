<!-- The piece you're producing will eventually become a Wordpress template. For now, you can produce a simple HTML page. The PHP get_header() function above will eventually add in a real HTML head, but for now, so that this page will run, I've included some simple HTML boilerplate to get you started. It includes jQuery, as you can see, and the responsive 1140 CSS grid, which you're free to use or ignore.

The body of the HTML document includes some PHP snippets, which will determine the paywall behavior of the page. There are three access levels: full access, trial access (generally full access, but with a call-to-subscribe message), and no access. In practical terms, this means that there will need to be some way to hide the bulk of the article from people without access. The approach I used for the "Block by Block" map (http://bklynr.com/block-by-block-brooklyns-past-and-present/) seems to work well. There, I covered the interactive map with a full-window div that contained an introductory message. A button remove the div and reveals the map, and I simple hid the button from non-subscribers. Not a bulletproof solution, obviously, but effective enough.  -->
